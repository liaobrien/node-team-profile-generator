After entering the initializing Node command, the user is first prompted with questions regarding the manager's information such as name, ID number, email, and office number. Once those are complete, a list prompt appears where the user can decide if they want to add an engineer or intern to their team roster, and answer questions about their respective information. Once the user is done adding teammates, they can select "I'm Done" from the list options, and a styled index.html file is automatically generated in the output directory.
